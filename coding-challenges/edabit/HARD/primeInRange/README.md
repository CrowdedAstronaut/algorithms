Any Prime Number in Range
Create a function that returns true if there's at least one prime number in the given range (n1 to n2 (inclusive)), false otherwise.

Examples
primeInRange(10, 15) ➞ true
// Prime numbers in range: 11, 13

primeInRange(62, 66) ➞ false
// No prime numbers in range.

primeInRange(3, 5) ➞ true
// Prime numbers in range: 3, 5
Notes
n2 is always greater than n1.
n1 and n2 are always positive.
0 and 1 aren't prime numbers.
