### The Modulus Operator Function

Create a function that will work as the modulus operator % without using the modulus operator. The modulus operator is a way to determine the remainder of a division operation. Instead of returning the result of the division, the modulo operation returns the whole number remainder.

Examples
mod(5, 2) ➞ 1

mod(218, 5) ➞ 3

mod(6, 3) ➞ 0
Notes
Don't use the % operator to return the results.
