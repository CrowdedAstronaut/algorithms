### Array Index

Given a 2D-list of letters arr and a list of indexes idx, find the letters on given indexes and return as a string.

arr = [
["m", "u", "b"],
["a", "s", "h"],
["i", "r", "1"]
]

idx = [1, 3, 5, 8]
You have to find the characters in these indexes of the given list if you think of the indexes as:

[
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9]
]
arrIndex(lst, idx) âžž "mbsr"
