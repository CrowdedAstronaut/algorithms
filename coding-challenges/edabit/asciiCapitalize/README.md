Capitalize by ASCII
Create a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code is even and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.

Examples
asciiCapitalize("to be or not to be!") ➞ "To Be oR NoT To Be!"

asciiCapitalize("THE LITTLE MERMAID") ➞ "THe LiTTLe meRmaiD"

asciiCapitalize("Oh what a beautiful morning.") ➞ "oH wHaT a BeauTiFuL moRNiNg."
